# Java Concurrency: Set Game Project

This repository contains my implementation of a multithreaded version of the "Set" card game, developed as part of a university assignment in Java. The project focuses on Java concurrency, synchronization, and thread-safe design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To implement the core logic of the Set card game using Java threads, where multiple players (human or simulated) compete in real-time to find valid sets of cards based on shared features.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Threads and Synchronization
- Maven (Build tool)
- JUnit (for testing)
- Swing-based User Interface (provided by course)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java** and **Maven** installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Niv-Yaakobov/java-concurrency-set-game.git
   cd java-concurrency-set-game
